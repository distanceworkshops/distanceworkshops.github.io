# Online workshop: analysis of camera trap data with distance sampling, October 2021

Are you concerned about missing animals on the transect line or point?  This is the workshop for you!

## Overview



## Instructors

- [Eric Howe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dwrq7t8AAAAJ&hl=en), Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, 
- [Samantha Strindberg](https://blog.wcs.org/photo/author/sstrindberg/), Wildlife Conservation Society, 
- [Len Thomas](http://lenthomas.org), CREEM University of St Andrews and

## Timing

18th and 21st October 2021, 15:00-17:30 UK time.

## Enrollment limit

Registration is limited to 15 participants, to allow us to run the workshop with participant involvement.

## Format and Delivery method

The workshop will be a mix of live online interactive sessions, delivered via videoconference software (Microsoft Teams), and computer exercises.   There will be four sessions, on successive days, each lasting three hours. In addition, there will be practical exercises to be attempted outside of the meetings.  The practicals will be carried out in R, using the facility of RStudio/Cloud.  This will alleviate the need to install necessary R packages on personal computers.  However, use of RStudio/Cloud does require reasonable internet bandwidth.

## Content

-	Day 1.  Mark recapture distance sampling.  The session will begin with an interactive lecture.  We introduce the general problem area of missing animals at distance zero and its implications for abundance estimation, before moving on to solutions based on mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS, also called double-platform distance sampling).  MRDS is designed to deal with perception bias and, in some circumstances, availability bias.  After introducing the concepts, we review the available software for estimation.  We then take a break from the videoconference for you to undertake a computer exercise (with online text-based support if required).  We reconvene on video to discuss the exercise, before moving to a second interactive lecture where we deal with further topics including a review of assumptions, methods for duplicate identification and point transect methods.  We close with a discussion session.
-	Day 2.  Dealing explicitly with availability bias.  In some contexts, availability bias may be the main source of bias, and in such situations you may need to deal with it explicitly rather than relying on MRDS methods. An extreme example is aerial video surveys of marine mammals, where it might be reasonable to assume that with sufficient care in processing video footage, perception bias in the narrow field of view of the camera(s) is negligible and that the only reason animals are missed is because they are underwater while within the camera’s view. We will describe a variety of methods of dealing explicitly with availability bias, in an interactive lecture covering methods ranging from applying simple availability “correction factors”, to methods that simultaneously model the availability and detection processes.  The methods will be illustrated using applications to real datasets, although at present no user-friendly software is available for participants to experiment with on their own. We will also briefly cover newly-developed methods designed for drone surveys in which duplicates are not identified.  We will finish with a question-and-answer session.
-	Day 3. 
-	Day 4.

## Prerequisites

You should already know about distance sampling, for example by having taken a face-to-face introductory workshop or an online workshop (either interactive or via our [free pre-recorded lectures](https://workshops.distancesampling.org/online-course/) ).  You should also have modest experience using R. We will offer pre-workshop group meetings to check the video-conferencing software.

## Registration and Payment

The Registration Fee is 150GBP.

To register and pay, please follow this link and click on the Book Event button.

Once you have registered, we will contact you to collect some follow-up information.

Registration will close when the workshop fills, or 20 August 2021, whichever is first to run tests with participants on the video-conference system.

All participants are asked to abide by our [workshop code of conduct](code-of-conduct).
