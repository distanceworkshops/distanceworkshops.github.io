# Online workshop: Practical design and simulation to optimise distance sampling sureys, March 2021

## Overview

Distance sampling is a design based method, and as such, good survey design is critical for obtaining valid results. We have spent the last few years developing distance sampling survey design and simulation capabilities in R and we are now celebrating the 2021 release of our new simulation package ‘dsims' with the introduction of this workshop on design and simulation. This workshop will give participants the insight into how to take survey design theory and apply it in the real world via a number of case studies including a marine survey, and both line and point transect terrestrial surveys. We will then demonstrate how to validate and optimise survey designs using ‘dsims’, thereby ensuring that we are achieving the most reliable results given the specific survey in question. We will also consider how ‘dsims’ could be used as a tool to justify survey effort / costings when looking to fund your surveys.

## Instructors

Laura Marshall and Len Thomas

## Timing

15th - 17th March
15:30-17:00 GMT

## Enrollment limit

15 participants.

## Format and Delivery method

The workshop will be a mix of live online interactive sessions, delivered via videoconference software (Microsoft Teams), and computer exercises. There will be three sessions in total, on successive days, with a total class time of 4.5 hours (including breaks) and two additional computer exercises to complete. It is advisable to allow around an hour and a half between days 1 and 2, and days 2 and 3 to complete these exercises. The exercises are in R using the ‘dssd’ and ‘dsims’ packages.

## Content

Day 1: We will start the workshop with an interactive lecture on design with time for questions and discussion afterwards. This will be followed by a short introduction to QGIS and formatting shape files for use with ‘dssd’ and ‘dsims’. A link to a video will also be provided giving you a detailed walk though of the steps needed to create both single and multi-strata shapefiles in QGIS, for digestion at your own convenience. Following the interactive session on day 1 we then advise you attempt the survey design practical. 

Day 2: We will start the second day with a discussion of the survey design practical. We will then give an introduction to the simulation capabilities of ‘dssd’ and how they can be used to strengthen funding applications and improve your survey design based on the specific characteristics of your study. Following the interactive session on day 2 we then advise you attempt the simulation practical. 

Day 3: The third day will start with a discussion of the simulation practical. The rest of this session will then be open for discussion of any design or simulation considerations relevant to surveys being planned by participants. Please sign up early and get in touch to let us know about the surveys you are planning to undertake!

## Prerequisites

You should already know about distance sampling survey design, for example by having taken a face-to-face introductory workshop or the design section of the online workshop (either interactive or via our free pre-recorded lectures ). You should also have some experience of using R, and have the relevant software downloaded and installed in advance of the workshop. We will offer pre-workshop group meetings to check the video-conferencing software, and that you have the software correctly installed.
