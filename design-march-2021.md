# Online workshop: Practical design and simulation to optimise distance sampling sureys, March 2021

## Overview

Distance sampling is a design based method, and as such, good survey design is critical for obtaining valid results. We have spent the last few years developing distance sampling survey design and simulation capabilities in R and we are now celebrating the 2021 release of our new simulation package ‘dsims' with the introduction of this workshop on design and simulation. This workshop will give participants the insight into how to take survey design theory and apply it in the real world via a number of case studies including a marine survey, and both line and point transect terrestrial surveys. We will then demonstrate how to validate and optimise survey designs using ‘dsims’, thereby ensuring that we are achieving the most reliable results given the specific survey in question. We will also consider how ‘dsims’ could be used as a tool to justify survey effort / costings when looking to fund your surveys.

LT suggested para, based on Laura's:

Good survey design is critical for obtaining reliable results in distance sampling surveys.  Our introductory workshops teach the basic concepts, but here we go beyond this to give practical advice and experience on using software tools to create a good design.  The workshop will give participants the skills they need to design surveys to best meet their survey objectives while respecting budgetary and logistical constraints.  

We will introduce a series of case studies including marine and terrestrial surveys, both point and line transects.  We will show how to use our `R` package `dssd` to create a survey design, and our new package `dsims` to create and run simulation studies to compare different designs and optimize design choices.  We will also demonstrate the use of QGIS to obtain requisite input information.  Participants will gain experience with survey design and simulation through a set of exercises.

The workshop is designed to be interactive in format, with a chance for participants to discuss their own design problems.

## Instructors

Laura Marshall and Len Thomas

## Timing

15th - 17th March
15:30-17:00 GMT

## Enrollment limit

15 participants.

## Format and Delivery method

The workshop will be a mix of live online interactive sessions, delivered via videoconference software (Microsoft Teams), and computer exercises. There will be three sessions in total, on successive days, with a total class time of 4.5 hours (including breaks) and two additional computer exercises to complete. It is advisable to allow around an hour and a half between days 1 and 2, and days 2 and 3 to complete these exercises. The exercises are in `R` using the `dssd` and `dsims` packages.  We will demonstrate the use of QGIS, but it is not required on particpants computers.

## Content

Day 1: We will start the workshop with an interactive lecture on design with time for questions and discussion afterwards. This will be followed by a short introduction to QGIS and formatting shape files for use with `dssd` and `dsims`. A link to a video will also be provided giving you a detailed walk though of the steps needed to create both single and multi-strata shapefiles in QGIS, for digestion at your own convenience. Lastly, we will introduce a survey design practical for you to complete before the start of day 2.

Day 2: We will start the second day with a discussion of the survey design practical. We will then give an introduction to the simulation capabilities of `dssd` and how they can be used to help optimize planned surveys by forcasting survey accuracy.  Apart from its practical use, a well-implemented simulation study can help strenghten funding applications, providing reasoned justification for requested resources.  We will introduce a simulation practical to be completed before the start of day 3. 

Day 3: The third day will start with a discussion of the simulation practical. The rest of this session will then be open for discussion of any design or simulation considerations relevant to surveys being planned by participants. Please sign up early and get in touch to let us know about the surveys you are planning to undertake!

## Prerequisites

You should already know about distance sampling survey design, for example by having taken a face-to-face introductory workshop or the design section of the online workshop (either interactive or via our free pre-recorded lectures ). You should also have some experience of using `R`, and have the relevant software downloaded and installed in advance of the workshop. We will offer pre-workshop group meetings to check the video-conferencing software, and that you have the design software correctly installed.
