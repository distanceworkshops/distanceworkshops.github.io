# Online workshop: Spatially explicit models for distance sampling data: density surface modelling in practice


## Overview

This online course will cover how to fit spatial models to distance sampling data ("density surface modelling") in R. This will include:

- Brief overview of distance sampling
- Generalized additive models
- Fitting, checking and selecting density surface models
- Predicting abundance
- Making maps

Examples will be based around a line transect survey of sperm whales in the western Atlantic.


## Instructors

David L Miller

## Timing

16th-20th August 2021, 16:00-18:00 GMT.

## Enrollment limit

Registration is limited to 14 participants.

## Format and Delivery method

The course will consist of 5 live sessions delivered over videoconference. Between these sessions there will be practical R exercises to complete and to assist with these practicals there will be text-based "office hours", where participants questions can be addressed. Each videoconference session will include time for lecturing and discussion of practical exercises.

## Prerequisites

You should already know about distance sampling, for example by having taken a face-to-face introductory workshop or an online workshop (either interactive or via our [free pre-recorded lectures](https://workshops.distancesampling.org/online-course/) ). You should also have experience using R, and have the relevant software downloaded and installed in advance of the workshop. We will offer pre-workshop group meetings to check the video-conferencing software, and that you have the software correctly installed.

## Registration and Payment
