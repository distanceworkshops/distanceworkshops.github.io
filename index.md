# Distance Sampling Workshops

Here you can find content for distance sampling workshops including slides, exercises and other materials.

## Free online course

[Online distance sampling introductory workshop](online-course): a full introductory workshop, including recorded video lectures, exercises and quizzes.

## Forthcoming interactive online workshops

We are holding the following online workshops:

- [Introductory distance sampling workshop](intro-jul-2023) 10-21 July 2023
  - Registration now open (closing date: **21 June 2023**)
- [Distance sampling when animals are missed at zero distance, 14-16 August 2023](https://workshops.distancesampling.org/mrds-aug-2023)
  - [Registration open](https://onlineshop.st-andrews.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/events/creem/online-workshop-distance-sampling-when-animals-are-missed-at-zero-distance-1416th-august-2023) - closing date 31 July 2023.
- [Practical design and simulation to optimise distance sampling surveys 28-31 August 2023](https://workshops.distancesampling.org/design-aug-2023)
  - [Registration open](https://onlineshop.st-andrews.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/events/creem/online-workshoppractical-design-and-simulation-to-optimise-distance-sampling-surveys-2831-aug-23) - closing date 14 August 2023. 

Please [email us](mailto:distance@st-andrews.ac.uk) if you are interested in joining a future live online workshop on the following topics: (1) introduction to distance sampling; (2) camera trap distance sampling.

## Widening participation scholarships

We are committed to encouraging participation in our distance sampling workshops by scientists from countries with fewer resources, and from groups traditionally under-represented in wildlife science. To this end, we will donate one free place on most workshops, covering the cost of the registration fee.  For more information about the scheme, please see our [widening participation scholarship](widening-participation) page.  

## Workshop code of conduct

All instructors and participants are required to adhere to our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct).
