# Distance Sampling Workshops

Here you can find content for distance sampling workshops including slides, exercises and other materials.

## Free online course

[Online distance sampling introductory workshop](online-course): a full introductory workshop, including recorded video lectures, exercises and quizzes.


## Forthcoming interactive workshops

The following workshops are currently planned.  We will post further updates here, on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/distancesamp) and on the [distance sampling mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling).

- [Introductory distance sampling training workshop 10-21 January 2022](http://workshops.distancesampling.org/intro-jan-2022)
  - This workshop will take place online, and will be a mixture of live lectures and computer exercises 
  - Registration now open; registration closes _06 December 2021_

We plan to offer further online workshops later 2022, and will publish a timetable shortly.

## Widening participation scholarships

We are committed to encouraging participation in our distance sampling workshops by scientists from countries with fewer resources, and from groups traditionally under-represented in wildlife science. To this end, we will donate one free place on most workshops, covering the cost of the registration fee.  For more information about the scheme, please see our [widening participation scholarship](widening-participation) page.  

## Workshop code of conduct

All instructors and participants are required to adhere to our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct).
