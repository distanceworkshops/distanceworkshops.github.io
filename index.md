# Distance Sampling Workshops

Here you can find content for distance sampling workshops including slides, exercises and other materials.

## Free online course

[Online distance sampling introductory workshop](online-course): a full introductory workshop, including recorded video lectures, exercises and quizzes.


## Forthcoming interactive workshops

The following workshops are being planned.  We will post further updates here, on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/distancesamp) and on the [distance sampling mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling).

### Summer 2021

- [*Spatially explicit models for distance sampling data: density surface modelling in practice*](online-dsm-2021), 16th-20th August 2021 ([Registration link](https://onlineshop.st-andrews.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/events/creem/spatially-explicit-models-for-distance-sampling-data-training-workshop-live-online-1620-august-2021?token=533641e57231051f2f47efb5c929f0fe)).
