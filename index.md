# Distance Sampling Workshops

Here you can find content for distance sampling workshops including slides, exercises and other materials.

## Free online course

[Online distance sampling introductory workshop](online-course): a full introductory workshop, including recorded video lectures, exercises and quizzes.

## Forthcoming interactive online workshops

We are holding the following workshop:

- Distance Live introductory online workshop, 20-31 March 2023
  - Registration to open at the end of January

We are also in the early stages of planning workshops for spring 2023.  We will post further updates here, on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/distancesamp) and on the [distance sampling mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling).  Please [email us](mailto:distance@st-andrews.ac.uk) if you are interested in joining a future workshop on the following topics: (1) camera trap distance sampling; (2) distance sampling when animals are missed at zero distance; (3) survey design and simulation.

## Widening participation scholarships

We are committed to encouraging participation in our distance sampling workshops by scientists from countries with fewer resources, and from groups traditionally under-represented in wildlife science. To this end, we will donate one free place on most workshops, covering the cost of the registration fee.  For more information about the scheme, please see our [widening participation scholarship](widening-participation) page.  

## Workshop code of conduct

All instructors and participants are required to adhere to our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct).
