# Distance Sampling Workshops

Here you can find content for distance sampling workshops including slides, exercises and other materials.

## Free online course

[Online distance sampling introductory workshop](online-course): a full introductory workshop, including recorded video lectures, exercises and quizzes.


## Forthcoming interactive workshops

We plan to offer the following workshops in 2021, all delivered remotely, via live online video.

### Summer 2021

We will soon be announcing workshop offerings for summer 2021. These will to include the following:

- Introduction to distance sampling
- Density surface modelling
- Survey design and simulation
- Distance sampling when animals are missed at zero distance

We will post further updates here, on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/distancesamp) and on the [distance sampling mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling).
