## Current

As a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak registration for the August Distance Workshops in St Andrews has been suspended. We'll provide a more detailed update by 3rd April.

We are preparing to deliver the courses, in some form, by videoconference. We will post updates here, on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/distancesamp) and on the [distance sampling mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling).

Stay safe folks!
