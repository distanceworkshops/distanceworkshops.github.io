## Widening participation scholarships

We are committed to encouraging participation in our distance sampling workshops by scientists from countries with fewer resources, and from groups traditionally under-represented in wildlife science. To this end, we will donate one free place on each workshop, covering the cost of the registration fee.  For more information about the scheme, plese see our [widening participation schoarship](widening-participation) page.  

## Workshop code of conduct

All instructors and participants are required to adhere to our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct).
