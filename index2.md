## Forthcoming interactive workshops

We plan to offer the following workshops in 2021, all of them delivered remotely, via live online video.

### Winter and spring 2021

- 11th - 12th January 2021.  [*Distance sampling when animals are missed at zero distance*](http://workshops.distancesampling.org/mrds-jan-2020.md)
  - _Registration opening soon_
-  8th - 12th March 2021.  Spatially explicit models for distance sampling data: density surface modelling in practice
- 15th - 17th March 2021.  Practical design and simulation to optimise distance sampling sureys.

### Summer 2021

We are in the early stages of planning our workshop offerings for late spring and summer 2021.  These are likely to incllude the following:

- Introduction to distance sampling
- Density surface modelling
- Distance samplgin when animals are missed at zero distance

We will post further updates here, on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/distancesamp) and on the [distance sampling mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling).
